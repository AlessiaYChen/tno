GCPE’s primary role is to inform the public about government programs, services, policies, and priorities through traditional communication practices and, increasingly, through direct engagement and online services.

One of GCPE’s featured services to clients is Today’s News Online Media Monitoring. Through this application, GCPE tracks breaking news stories in British Columbia, Canada, and around the world that impact our province.

The TNO application provides a variety of key services to senior executives throughout government including near-live issue alerts, morning and evening summary reports, as well as in-depth media analysis of key government initiatives and issues.

The application also provides government staff with direct access to all events held in the Legislature Press Theatre including Dr. Bonnie Henry's weekly press conferences on the COVID-19 outbreak.

Today's News Online (TNO) is a news aggregation system that takes in news sources of varying types and provides a single location for clients to access the data.
